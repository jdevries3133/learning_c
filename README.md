# Learning C

I want to learn C. Each folder contains the examples as I work through
different resources.

## Table of Contents

| folder | contents                                                          |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| k&r    | example files from the Kernighan and Ritchie book                 |
| tree   | following along with Jacob Sorber, "How to Implement a Tree in C" |
